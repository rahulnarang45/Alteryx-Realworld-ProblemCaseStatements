# Alteryx-Realworld-ProblemCaseStatements

Excited to share how I leveraged Alteryx to tackle four challenging data problems!

🔍 Case Study 1: Data has been collected on monthly expenditures on the restaurants for individuals in two neighboring towns. First, combine the
datasets (dataset 1 and dataset 2) and identify the top 10% of people that spend the most on restaurants. Of these people, how many are females 50
years of age or older?

🎯 Case Study 2: Open dataset contains information of the airports and the other dataset contains information on the runways at those airports. Which airport
in the "US-Tregion has the longest lighted runway?


🔗 Case Study 3: The provided dataset shows the results from a trivia night. Six friends are split into two teams to play several round of trivia. In each round,
there are multiple questions worth one point each and every player answer separately.

Which player earned the highest point total?
Which team earned the highest point total?

📑 Case Study 4: Refer car entrance sheet: which month has largest amount of vehicle that enter into the park

💡 Alteryx Tools Used: 

Union Tool:
Combines multiple datasets into one by stacking them vertically. It matches columns either by name or position.

Sample Tool:
Selects a specified number or percentage of rows from the dataset, allowing for random or sequential sampling.

Join Tool:
Merges two datasets based on a common field (key). It outputs matched records and optionally unmatched records from either dataset.

Text to Columns Tool:
Splits a single text field into multiple columns based on a specified delimiter, useful for parsing structured text data.

Summarize Tool:
Performs various summary calculations such as count, sum, average, min, max, and group by operations on the dataset, providing aggregated insights.


Alteryx's intuitive interface and powerful tools made solving these problems not only possible but efficient and enjoyable. If you're looking to streamline your data processes and gain deeper insights, I highly recommend exploring what Alteryx has to offer! 💼🔍
